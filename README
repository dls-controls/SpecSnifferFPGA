The project is back compatible with existing Diamond FA Sniffer running on
Xilinx ML555 board.

However, the kernel driver has some extra work to do:
    - There additional registers on BAR0 to get some diagnostics information on
design clocking resources.
    - PCIe configuration space on BAR4 must be configured to set up external GN4124 Pcie clock frequencies, and MSI interrupts.

NOT SUPPORTED (,yet):

- Pci-e TLP size is hardwired to 128 Bytes (unlike ML555).
- CC NodeID for the sniffer board is hardwired to 0 (same on ML555 design).
- CC Frame length is hardwired to 7500 clock cycles (same on ML555 design).
- Link Errors are not reported. User should check partner BPM's status information (it is reported on ML555). User can also check link_partner whihc is reported.

Usage:

Makefile contains an upload target to configure the FPGA using ISE generated
spec_top.bin file, and the speclib library. The target PC in the Makefile where the board is installed should be modifed for correct ssh connection.
